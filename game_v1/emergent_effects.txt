EMERGENT EFFECTS IN TREE ECOSYSTEM SIMULATION
==============================================

This document describes how different species property values affect simulation behavior
and emergent patterns that arise from their interactions.

SPECIES PROPERTIES
==================

1. ageToSpread (integer)
   - Age at which trees can produce offspring
   - Lower values = faster population growth
   - Higher values = slower colonization, more vulnerable to early crowding death

2. maxSize (integer)
   - Maximum size a tree can reach
   - Larger = more competitive (dominates smaller neighbors in crowdedness calculations)
   - Larger = longer time to reach maturity

3. spreadChance (0.0-1.0)
   - Probability of spreading each turn after reaching ageToSpread
   - Higher = exponential population growth
   - Lower = steady-state population

4. spreadDistance (0.0-1.0, normalized coordinates)
   - Maximum distance offspring can spawn from parent
   - Higher = faster territorial expansion, less clustering
   - Lower = tight clusters, intense local competition

5. color (hex)
   - Visual only, no gameplay effect


EMERGENT COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS
==============================

CROWDEDNESS MECHANICS:
- Only larger trees contribute to a smaller tree's crowdedness
- Crowded trees (probability 1-crowdedness):
  - Stop growing (size frozen)
  - 10% chance of death per turn (CROWDED_DEATH_CHANCE)
- Distance matters: closer large trees = more crowding effect
- Size difference matters: much larger trees affect from further away
  (maxDistance = spreadDistance * sizeDiff / maxSize)


SPECIES ARCHETYPES & STRATEGIES
================================

FAST COLONIZER (Pine-like):
- Low ageToSpread (3-7)
- High spreadChance (0.15-0.25)
- Low spreadDistance (0.05-0.15)
- Medium maxSize (10-15)

Behavior:
- Rapidly fills empty space with dense clusters
- Vulnerable to being outcompeted by larger species later
- "Pioneer species" - dominates early game
- Can maintain population through sheer numbers despite crowding losses

Expected outcome:
- Early population boom
- Forms dense forests that prevent own growth
- Eventually dominated by larger species in contested areas
- Survives in isolated pockets


SLOW GIANT (Oak-like):
- High ageToSpread (12-20)
- Low spreadChance (0.05-0.12)
- High spreadDistance (0.15-0.3)
- High maxSize (18-25)

Behavior:
- Slow to establish but devastating once mature
- Large size creates wide "shadow" of crowding
- Kills smaller neighbors even from distance
- Low density allows each tree to reach full size

Expected outcome:
- Loses territory early to fast colonizers
- Gradually reclaims space as mature trees crowd out competitors
- Late-game dominance if survives to maturity
- Lower total population but higher individual survival rate


BALANCED GENERALIST (Maple-like):
- Medium ageToSpread (8-12)
- Medium spreadChance (0.12-0.20)
- Medium spreadDistance (0.10-0.20)
- Medium maxSize (12-18)

Behavior:
- Moderate expansion rate
- Can coexist with both fast and slow species
- Neither dominates nor gets dominated completely
- Fills niches between clusters

Expected outcome:
- Steady population growth
- Maintains presence throughout game
- Forms "buffer zones" between dominant species
- Population fluctuates with competition but rarely goes extinct


INTER-SPECIES DYNAMICS
=======================

SUCCESSION PATTERNS:
1. Empty space → Fast colonizer dominates (dense clusters)
2. Fast colonizer → Self-crowding limits growth
3. Slow giant saplings survive in crowded fast-colonizer forest
4. Slow giants mature → Crowd out fast colonizers from distance
5. Slow giant dominance → Spreads slowly due to low spreadChance
6. Gaps in slow giant coverage → Fast colonizers re-establish
7. Cycle continues with territorial ebb and flow

SPATIAL PATTERNS:

Clustering (low spreadDistance):
- Dense monoculture patches
- Sharp boundaries between species
- High crowding death rate
- Vulnerable to invasion at edges

Dispersal (high spreadDistance):
- Mixed species neighborhoods
- Gradual species gradients
- Lower crowding (trees more spread out)
- Better at invading competitor territory

EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS:
Species can coexist long-term if:
- Different size classes (large species doesn't crowd similar-sized species)
- Different spreading rates (fast spreader maintains numbers despite crowding)
- Spatial separation (different territories with slow mixing)
- Temporal niches (one dominates early, other late)


EXTREME CONFIGURATIONS
=======================

UNSTABLE (extinction risk):
- Low spreadChance + High ageToSpread + Low maxSize
  → Dies before reproducing, crowded out by everything

- High spreadDistance + Low spreadChance
  → Can't establish territory, offspring too dispersed

DOMINANT (likely winner):
- High spreadChance + Low ageToSpread + High maxSize
  → Fast reproduction, early maturity, outcompetes everything
  → May cause other species extinction

STABLE COEXISTENCE:
- Species with different maxSize tiers (e.g., 10, 15, 20)
- Inverse relationship: faster spread = smaller size
- Non-overlapping spreadDistance ranges


PARAMETER TUNING GUIDELINES
============================

For competitive balance:
- Make spreadChance inversely proportional to maxSize
  (bigger trees should spread slower)

- Make ageToSpread proportional to maxSize
  (bigger trees take longer to mature)

- Keep spreadDistance relatively similar OR make larger species spread further
  (allows large trees to escape their crowding effect)

For diverse outcomes:
- Vary all parameters significantly between species
- Avoid linear scaling (don't just multiply everything by 1.5)
- Create clear strategic differences

For stable coexistence:
- Ensure each species has a condition where it outperforms others
- Fast species: wins in empty space
- Large species: wins in crowded conditions
- Medium species: wins in mixed conditions


CURRENT CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS
================================

Pine: ageToSpread=5, maxSize=15, spreadChance=0.15, spreadDistance=0.1
Maple: ageToSpread=8, maxSize=15, spreadChance=0.25, spreadDistance=0.15
Oak: ageToSpread=12, maxSize=20, spreadChance=0.20, spreadDistance=0.2

Predicted behavior:
- Maple dominates early (highest spreadChance + medium ageToSpread)
- Pine struggles (same maxSize as Maple but slower spread)
- Oak eventually dominates contested areas (only large species)
- Maple and Oak will likely drive Pine to low populations
- Oak's high spreadChance (0.20) for a large species may make it too strong

Suggested changes for balance:
- Increase Pine maxSize to 12 OR reduce to make it truly "pioneer"
- Reduce Oak spreadChance to 0.08-0.12 (large trees shouldn't spread so fast)
- Or increase Oak ageToSpread to 15-18 to delay dominance
