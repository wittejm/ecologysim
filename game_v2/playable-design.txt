# Playable Design: Interactive Ecosystem Sandbox

## Core Philosophy
Let users explore, experiment, and discover emergent patterns. Balance scientific curiosity with game-like satisfying feedback.

## Interactive Features

### 1. Parameter Sliders (Real-time Tuning)
- **Live sliders** for key parameters (tree spread rate, deer reproduction, starvation penalty)
- Changes apply to NEW entities only (existing trees/deer keep their birth parameters)
- Visual feedback: slider color changes based on current system health (green=stable, yellow=volatile, red=collapse)
- "Presets" dropdown: Stable Oscillations, Chaos Mode, Deer Paradise, Forest Dominance
- "Mutation Rate" slider: crank it up for rapid evolution, down for genetic stability
- **Why fun:** Immediate cause-effect, scientific experimentation without consequences

### 2. Minimap / God View
- **Small draggable window** (150x150px) showing entire 1.0x1.0 world
- Main view shows zoomed portion (e.g., 0.3x0.3 region)
- Click minimap to pan main view
- Minimap uses simplified rendering: trees as green dots, deer as brown dots, elevation as subtle gradient
- **Toggle layers:** population density heatmap, cluster color overlay, elevation only
- **Why fun:** Spatial awareness, discover hidden pockets of diversity, follow deer migrations

### 3. Direct Interventions (God Powers)
**Tools (selectable via toolbar):**
- 🪓 **Axe Tool:** Click trees to instantly remove them (test recovery dynamics)
- 🦌 **Cull Tool:** Click deer to remove (control overpopulation)
- 🌱 **Plant Tool:** Click to add new tree at cursor (with current avg genetics OR random)
- 🦌 **Spawn Deer:** Click to add deer (with current avg genetics OR mutant)
- 🔥 **Fire Tool:** Drag circle, kills all trees/deer in area (test resilience)
- 🌧️ **Flood Tool:** Temporarily boosts tree growth in selected area (lasts 100 ticks)
- ⚡ **Lightning:** Random tree -> instant max size (create safe zones for deer)

**Why fun:** Tactile, immediate, test "what if I remove this cluster?", create challenges

### 4. Event System (Random Challenges)
- **Drought** (200 ticks): Tree growth halved, deer starvation penalty doubled
- **Plague** (deer only): 50% of deer instantly die, survivors immune (genetic bottleneck!)
- **Meteor Strike:** Random 0.2x0.2 area cleared entirely
- **Spring Boom:** All trees reproduce 3x for 50 ticks
- **User can trigger events** via button panel OR they happen randomly (toggle on/off)
- **Why fun:** Drama, recovery narratives, test system resilience

### 5. Goals & Challenges (Game Mode)
**Sandbox Mode** (current): No objectives, just explore
**Challenge Mode:**
- "Sustain 3 deer clusters for 2000 ticks" (diversity preservation)
- "Survive a drought event without deer extinction"
- "Recover from 90% tree loss to stable oscillation"
- "Evolve a deer with speed>0.8 AND appetite<0.3" (efficiency specialist)
- Timer, success/fail feedback, leaderboard (local browser storage)

**Why fun:** Purpose, achievement, replayability

### 6. Genetic Engineering (Advanced Interaction)
- **Select tool:** Click deer/tree to see full stats in sidebar
- **Edit mode:** Tweak selected entity's characteristics (growth, speed, etc.)
- **Clone tool:** Click entity, then click elsewhere to place genetic copy
- **Breed tool:** Click two deer -> spawn baby with averaged genetics + mutation
- Limit: Max 10 manual edits per 500 ticks (prevent overpowered god mode)
- **Why fun:** Directed evolution, test "super deer" vs normal population

### 7. Time Controls (Already Useful, Could Be Better)
- Current: Speed multiplier (x1, x10, x50)
- **Add:** Step-forward button (advance exactly 1 tick, then pause)
- **Add:** "Time travel" slider (scrub backward through last 1000 ticks of history)
- **Add:** Bookmark system: save current state, reload later (test alternate futures)
- **Why fun:** Precision control, no missing critical moments

### 8. Data Overlays (Visualization Modes)
**Toggle buttons to change what main view shows:**
- **Normal:** Trees green, deer brown, size-based rendering (current)
- **Genetics:** Color by cluster assignment (current K-means colors)
- **Energy:** Trees colored by growth rate, deer by energy level (gradient)
- **Age:** Younger = bright, older = dark (see generational turnover)
- **Density:** Heatmap of crowding (red = crowded, blue = sparse)
- **Elevation:** Just show terrain (debug mode)
- **Why fun:** Different perspectives reveal hidden patterns

### 9. Audio Feedback (Subtle, Optional)
- Soft rustling when deer move near trees
- Gentle chime when oscillation peak detected
- Ominous tone when population drops below 10
- Triumphant chord when challenge completed
- **Volume slider + mute button** (accessibility)
- **Why fun:** Emotional connection, audio cues aid monitoring

### 10. Narrative Framing (Make It a Story)
**Instead of "Ecosystem Simulation," call it:**
- "Isle of Evolution" - You're a nature spirit managing a remote island
- "EcoLab Alpha" - You're a scientist in a biodome testing theories
- "Genesis Project" - Terraform a barren world into thriving ecosystem

**Intro screen:**
- Brief backstory (2-3 sentences)
- "Your goal: Maintain balance... or break it and see what happens."
- Tutorial popup on first load (skippable)

**Why fun:** Context, feels like a game not a science project

## Quick Wins (Implement First)
1. **Parameter sliders** (high impact, moderate effort)
2. **Axe/Cull tools** (satisfying, easy to implement)
3. **Event triggers** (drama, moderate effort)
4. **Minimap** (helps navigation, moderate effort)

## Nice-to-Haves (Later)
5. Genetic engineering (complex UI)
6. Challenge mode (needs balancing)
7. Audio (polish)
8. Narrative framing (flavor)

## Technical Notes
- Use React state for tool selection (enum: None, Axe, Plant, etc.)
- Mouse click handler checks current tool, applies effect
- Events stored in ecosystem state with duration counter
- Minimap renders to separate canvas, scaled down
- History buffer: store last 1000 population snapshots for time-scrubbing

## Success Metrics
- **Time spent:** Users play >5 minutes (engaged)
- **Return rate:** Users come back next day (addictive)
- **Sharing:** Users screenshot interesting moments (social)
- **Discovery:** Users find emergent behaviors we didn't predict (depth)
